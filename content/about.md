### Who am I?

Well... my name is Nabeel Parkar. I go by `exabyt3` on the interwebs :D I am mostly a [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) developer, but I dabble in a lot of other technologies. Some of them are [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

### My story

I started out programming back in 2017. I was 17, and I had just completed school. I had a few months to kill before joining my computer engineering diploma course for 3 years. I started learning Java, got to for loops and quit. It wasn't until a year later, in my 2nd semester of diploma that I was introduced to C.

For 2 years, I learnt what college was teaching me, which in hindsight, was not a lot and of what they were teaching me, was outdated. We literally coded on TurboC++, which is a 16bit IDE made for MsDOS and half the code we wrote in C++ wouldn't even compile on today's compilers e.g. C++11; It was in my 5th semester, I finally decided to learn a language, which was Python. This really helped me clear programming fundamentals like OOP, some functional programming concepts, and basic logical programming.

### My career

We had to build a project at the end of the computer engineering diploma course. We had a year to decide, build and write a thesis on it. But, after 3 months, I didn't know what to do. And while my friends were picking projects and some even started on theirs, I was lost. I didn't want to take a generic project that someone builds every year, and I didn't have the knowledge or expertise to build some of the projects I wanted to like AR/VR projects.
